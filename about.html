      <p><span class="tab">Hi</span>, this is Nykola, the sole developer of Darkness Reclamation. I am a
      software engineering student and indie game developer.</p>
      <p>
      <span class="tab">My</span> main goal in starting this humble business is to make games that don't just
      play fundamental genres, but to attempt redefine them entirely. Part of this goal
      is achieved by rethinking the way games recieve input and deliver output, both in terms of
      visuals and audio cues. With unique approaches to old genres, new gameplay can be
      created, making a fresh experience for fans of them.</p>
      <p>
      <span class="tab">My</span> first project, Darness Reclamation, is taking the
      Metroidvania genre and redefining the way the player interacts and understands their surroundings,
      not only through visual signifigance, but also dynamically through musical changes while exploring.
